\chapter*{Problem Definition}
\initial{R}esurfacing after the tribulations of COVID-19, travel is becoming more prominent than ever as people more dynamic and popular is the branch of physics concerned with the study of the electromagnetic force. A DC motor is particularly helpful in visualising the interaction of the magnetic field with the electrical field and thus will be investigated in the following research report. This research report will detail the numerous factors that influence the efficiency of a DC Motor and will contain experimental data that reveals the effect these factors have. The three factors that will be researched and isolated in experiments is the effect of: the input energy (voltage), number of coils and position of coils. Ultimately, the research project will concatenate these results to find the optimal characteristics of a motor to maximise efficiency.

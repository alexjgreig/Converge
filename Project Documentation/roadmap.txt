- Rename the coin to converge, implement a more automated approach to creating key pairs for the businesses.

- Create the tokenisation of assets, look at the tutorial setout on pallet creation and how to reinstantiate pallets for multiple assets. Also tokenise the orders and all other process or entity of monterary value such as hours of labour. Possibly look into how information can be transferred without tokens, how can a company tokenise their liquid assets securely and accurately?

- Implementation of Procure-to-Pay and Quote to cash. Example. Retailer sends of digital token for the order. Smart contracts that automate the transaction of goods and services, once the order arrives smart contract is triggered to confirm the order has been recieved and then requests a working-capital loan form another node (bank), all automated. The bank verifies the order on the shared blockchain, approves the loan and records the loan's digital token on the blockchain.

- Smart contracts can be programmed to assess the status of a transaction and automatically take actions such as releasing a payment, recording ledger entries, and flagging exceptions in need of manual intervention.

- Login Page, Create the front end that the businesses will access. This will be seperate from the node that the business will run as their development team would set that up while the sales, management and financial team will access the portal to for supply chain and asset management. Front end should be visually appealing, possibly use the one that comes for the development environment.


- Create automated document creation or statistics that are visible, possibly using telemetrics...to track and show accounts payable and recieveable which could be used for tax purposes and records.

-Zero Knowledge Proofs to make the transactions more private and private information isn't widely shared across the blockchain.

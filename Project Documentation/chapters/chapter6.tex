\chapter{GANTT Chart}

All tasks that are mentioned within the Gantt chart are essential for achieving the minimum time frame and minimum viable product except: Automated document creation, Zero Knowledge proofs and complex smart contracts. The reason why this defines the minimum viable product is that the business blockchain can function without these modules. Therefore the dependence on these separate modules of the entire application is minimal and may be disregarded due to time limitations. The \href{run:./gantt.xlsx}{\textcolor{blue}{Gantt Chart}} outlines the tasks that need to be completed in order to design the program, it also outlines the measurement of time and the duration of each of the tasks. By clicking on the link above the Gantt Chart will be opened.

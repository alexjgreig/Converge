This sketch is a representation of the web frontend that each business will interact with to contribute to the blockchain. At the top the amount of converge tokens, fungible and non-fungible assets that a business currently owns is displayed. The user interface utilises radio buttons to select the different options associated with fungible and non-fungible assets while also implementing drop down and text boxes for input. The frontend also utilises scroll bars so more information can be fit into the design without cluttering its appearance. This interface is considerate of the user’s needs as it does not require a lot of technical understanding to operate. This ease-of-use of the software interface is a testament to the consideration of the audience’s needs.

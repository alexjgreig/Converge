\initial{T}he \href{run:./Video/Converge_Showcase.mp4}{\textcolor{blue}{Converge Showcase Video}} explains how to create your own node and setup up the cryptographic keys associated with that node. Then I demonstrate the way in which to set up a local business blockchain with two pre-built nodes and use a customised front end to be able to interact with the blockchain. It then goes into the features behind Converge and how it would represent a real world business blockchain. A tamper proof, transparent, efficient record that would enable businesses to trade and manage assets globally.
